                    Traditional Indian clothing depends largely on the religious group that people follow. 
                    Followers of Islam probably have the most distinct outfits. 
                    Islam guides that men and women must dress modestly. 
                    Islamic clothing is all about modesty. 
                    Both men and women have certain rules on what they can wear and what they canâ€™t. 
                    One distinctive feature of the Islamic pant is that they are airy and comfortable.
